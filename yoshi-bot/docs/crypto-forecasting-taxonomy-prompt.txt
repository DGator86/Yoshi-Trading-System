You are integrating a crypto forecasting system. Implement a modular ensemble
that includes 12 paradigms:
1. Technical feature generators (trend, mean reversion, vol regime, volume confirmation)
2. Classical stats (volatility/state-space/regime switching)
3. Macro/cross-asset factor residualization
4. Derivatives positioning module producing a Leverage Fragility Index (LFI) + tail risk
5. Microstructure/order flow module (OFI, trade imbalance, liquidity slope)
6. On-chain slow priors (cycle/risk context, not hourly timing)
7. Sentiment/attention modulators (extremes/reflexivity)
8. Tabular ML meta-learner over all features with strict walk-forward validation
9. Deep sequence model as distribution predictor (quantiles, not point price)
10. Regime state machine producing regime probabilities and gating weights
11. Scenario/Monte Carlo envelope generator using regime-conditioned vol + jumps
12. Optional crowd/binary market implied priors for barrier probability sanity checks

Hard requirements:
- Define prediction targets explicitly: returns, direction, quantiles, volatility, jump probability, regime.
- For each module: specify inputs, features, output type, conditions where it is trusted, and failure modes.
- Implement a gating policy that outputs module weights and a confidence scalar used to widen/narrow forecast distributions.
- Evaluate with walk-forward only; report calibration, quantile loss, Brier scores for tails, and per-regime metrics.

Output deliverables:
- A spec sheet (module interfaces + schemas)
- A regime taxonomy and gating rules
- An evaluation protocol and metrics list
