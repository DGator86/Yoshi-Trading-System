Build a crypto prediction engine for BTC/ETH/SOL using print-first quantized
time (notional trade buckets). Implement FeatureSignature from prints + L2 +
perp OI/funding + liquidation intensity + BTC coupling. Implement Hilbert
regime probability projection (5 regimes) with template fitting, entropy
overlay, Order posterior (5 constraints), Node posterior (25), age tracking,
and a semi-Markov duration-aware transition model (power-law survival + exit
matrix). Produce walkforward forward regime probabilities and a forward
collapse-location quantile fan (q05/q50/q95) using per-node Student-t return
models with Hurst (GHE) scaling. Output JSON overlay payload for historical
shading and forward projections. Use the module layout and function signatures
provided; prioritize correctness and determinism; candles are derived only for
visualization.
